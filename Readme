* Aero Nacre Thermal Shield - F.Mac31081991

This repository presents a theoretical geometric pattern for atmospheric reentry thermal shields, named Aero Nacre Thermal Shield.

The project proposes maintaining the traditional hexagonal geometry while introducing a universal overlapping coupling system inspired by nacre-like structures. The objective is to create a modular arrangement that combines manufacturing simplicity, geometric adaptability, and higher tolerance to structural vibrations.

Each hexagonal tile is fixed using a single mechanical anchoring point, referred to as the anchor. The theoretical premise is that a single-point fixation allows better accommodation of vibrations and micro-deformations, reducing the concentration of mechanical stresses commonly found in rigid multi-point attachment systems.

The external face of each tile has a concave geometry. In theory, this shape may favor partial flow reflection and surface turbulence shear, generating distributed micro-vortices. The conceptual goal is to avoid the concentration of turbulence and critical vibrations over large shield areas, reducing the risk of local aero-structural instabilities.

The coupling system is designed to allow stacking and overlapping between tiles, forming an interlocked structure with semi-flexible behavior, similar to a mesh of independent yet mechanically and thermally cooperative plates.

To enable application across different surface profiles, the project assumes that the spacecraft structure is designed using geometries derived from 120-degree angles. This theoretical choice aims to facilitate the creation of universal tiles capable of adapting to multiple curvature radii without requiring large families of different shapes.

This approach aligns with the fact that reentry vehicles are usually designed with smooth and continuous surfaces. Therefore, the geometry based on 120-degree angles and overlapping hexagons seeks compatibility with aerodynamic concepts of theoretical and experimental spacecraft.

It is important to emphasize that this project is in a conceptual and theoretical stage. The hypotheses related to aerodynamic behavior, micro-vortex generation, vibration dissipation, and mechanical load distribution have not yet been experimentally tested or validated through computational simulations.
